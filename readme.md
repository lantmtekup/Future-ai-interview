Sending u, a trial task for the AI engineer position, let's aim to have it done by early next week. Hopefully by Monday 12:00 PST the latest.

FutureAI Interview Task:
Objective:
Evaluate clustering, embeddings, and general model training knowledge on text data.

Steps:
1. Data Preparation:
Use the Kaggle email spam classification dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset:
Clean and tokenize the text.
Convert the most common words for each email into embeddings using any standard method
3. Clustering Task:
Perform a clustering task on the email text data using the word embeddings
Explain the choice of clustering algorithm and how the number of clusters was determined.
4. Classification Task:
Build a classification model to differentiate between spam and regular emails using the embeddings or other extracted features.
5. Insights:
Identify the top common words that appear in both spam and regular emails. Discuss any insights derived from these words in relation to the model's performance.
6. Deliverables:
Jupyter notebook or Python scripts with code and explanations.
7. Bonus Points:
- Analyze the clusters: For example, identify patterns or themes within the clusters.
- A short write-up summarizing the approach, choices made, and insights gained.
- Evaluate the performance of the classification model using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Time Expectation:
This task should take approximately 5-7 hours. (edited)
